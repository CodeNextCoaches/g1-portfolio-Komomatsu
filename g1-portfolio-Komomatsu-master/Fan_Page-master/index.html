			<h2>Plot</h2>
			<p align = "left"> In the beginning, the protagonist, Stafy, known as  Starfy in Western regions, was moving things around his home, Pufftop Palace, until he tripped and  dropped some things he was moving. One of them fell into the ocean,  which was the Magic Jar, an object that seals the antagonist of the game known as  Ogura. Meanwhile, a very severe thunderstorm with two tornadoes shook Starfy out of his home into the ocean. Later, Old Man Lobber encountered Starfy, and told him about the Magic Jar and Ogura, while he helped Starfy get back home, by making him do some swimming lessons, as well as giving  directions. While Starfy was heading back home, he encountered some people he didn't know before, such as Moe  the clam, and decided to help them with their problems, like finding their missing items,  defeating enemies, and so on, until Starfy and his friends fought and brought back  Ogura into the Magic Jar to restore peace. </p>
			<h2> Gameplay </h2>
			<p align = "left"> Starfy himself can run, jump, and attack via spinning; he also gains access to various transportation objects and animal familiars as the games progress. The game usually consists of multiple stages or worlds, with each stage split up into four sub-stages. Boss characters hide at the end of each world's final sub-stage. Most of the other sub-stages' goals are centered on retrieving a lost or stolen item for another character. The main task is to meet characters and find their missing items. There are many items to collect and many enemies to defeat. Players can move Starfy on land by running and jumping, but when Starfy is in watery areas, they can move him much more freely, make him push obstacles, and so on. The game also includes minigames, some of which are similar to Atari's Breakout series. </p>
